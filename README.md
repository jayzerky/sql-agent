SQL Agent Description
My custom SQL agent is a powerful data query and response system built using Python, LangChain, and Azure OpenAI. The agent streamlines the process of turning natural-language questions into actionable insights from a database. Here’s how it works step-by-step:

Natural Language to SQL Conversion

The user provides a prompt (a natural-language question).
This prompt is processed through LangChain, which interprets the user’s intent and converts it into a structured SQL query.
Database Query Execution

The generated SQL is then executed against the target database.
The resulting data (e.g., rows or aggregated metrics) is retrieved for further processing.
Post-Processing with LLM

The raw query results are passed through a Large Language Model (LLM). This initial pass translates or summarizes the data, ensuring the content is coherent and contextually relevant.
Refinement via Azure OpenAI

Finally, the LLM’s output is further refined by Azure OpenAI. This step cleans up the language, checks the factual correctness, and provides a more precise, human-friendly response.
User-Friendly Answer Delivery

The agent returns the final, polished answer to the user, complete with any relevant insights or summaries derived from the queried data.
This end-to-end flow enables seamless interaction between the user’s natural-language requests and the underlying database, producing easy-to-read, accurate responses. By leveraging LangChain for query generation and Azure OpenAI for refined language output, the SQL agent ensures that users receive concise and context-rich answers to their data-related questions.
